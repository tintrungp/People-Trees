# People Don't Grow On Trees

## Purpose
I think for a long time now, I've been thinking about this idea that people
don't grow on trees. It was inspired initially by a Mike Posner song, and 
has since stayed in my mind. I had thought about making an animation about it,
but I realized I was not good at animating, nor did I want to learn.

So, here I am, trying to make some sort of application to express this idea.
That people--you know, the ones you love, the ones you care about, the ones
that made you into the person you are today--they don't grow on trees.

## Inspiration
I had quite a few inspirations for this project.
- The fact that I always wanted to write letters of gratitude to people
  and never got around to it
- The verse where Paul talks about planting seeds, watering them, and
  God making them grow
- The verse of Job talking about fig trees and vines
- The verse of Jesus talking about how it's more blessed to give than 
  to receive
- The fact that I love the people in my life, and I ought to tell them
  how much they mean to me.
- Oh and also that I think when you love others, not only do you grow others,
  but you also grow yourself.

## Ideas
I had some ideas for this project.
- Making an app, where people plant seeds, and then they grow into trees.
  - The seeds would be people that you love
  - You water them with gratitude
  - They grow into trees
  - People are grown from the trees? Or maybe fruits?
  - The fruits could be summaries of the gratitude you have for the person
    - This could use AI to generate a summary of the gratitude
    - And maybe this could summarize what you value about your relationship
      or relationships as a whole

- Not sure if this would be a shared app, or if it would be solo
  - If it were shared, I would have to think about what way it could be purposeful

- Overall, I'd want this to make people grow in love for others
